##Executing the Software

If you are using a simulator (jMavSim):   

To use jmavsim:  
cd ~/src/Firmware  
make broadcast jmavsim  

Otherwise, simply note the IP Address of your quadrotor on the network.    

To run MAVROS: (Check the port / IP)  
For simulator:  
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@127.0.0.1:14557"  
For Serial / USB:  
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="serial:///dev/ttyACM0:921600"  
For real drone over WIFI:  
roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14550@192.168.4.1:14555"  

Launch ROSbridge  
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch  

Launch web-app  
open teammega_gui/index.html  

Launch team_mega  
rosrun teamMega teamMega  

Launch matlab  
matlab planner_sim.m  

After the above commands have been executed, you will be able to click landing locations and obstacles in the GUI, and observe the planner creating appropriate trajectories for the system, and then successfully flying the quadrotors.
